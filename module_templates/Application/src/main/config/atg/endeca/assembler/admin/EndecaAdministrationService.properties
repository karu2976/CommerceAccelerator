# By default this service is configured for a single EAC application.  If you wish to use multiple 
# EAC applications with your server then uncomment the the $class definition below and see the note 
# on the MultiAppAdministrationService below.
#
# $class==atg.endeca.assembler.MultiAppAdministrationService
#
# By using the MultiAppAdministrationService the storeFactories are automatically generated based on
# the application routing strategy and are added to the storeFactories property. Therefore you can
# remove the below configuration for the storeFactory property.
#
storeFactory=/atg/endeca/assembler/cartridge/manager/DefaultFileStoreFactory

#
# However, if hard coded custom storeFactories are required they can be added here as shown below.
#
#   storeFactories=\
#     /atg/endeca/assembler/cartridge/manager/FileStoreFactory_en,\
#     /atg/endeca/assembler/cartridge/manager/FileStoreFactory_es,\
