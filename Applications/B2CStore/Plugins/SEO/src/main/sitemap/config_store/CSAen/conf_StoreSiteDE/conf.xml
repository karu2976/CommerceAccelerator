Sitemap Config File - Allows user to specify most common settings
when generating sitemap index pages.
-->

<!--
Specifies the template file to use when building index pages and links.  
File path can be absolute, or relative to this file.  See sample 
template files for format details.

You may also want to use the html template:
<TEMPLATE_FILE>html_template.xml</TEMPLATE_FILE>

-->
<TEMPLATE_FILE>xml_template.xml</TEMPLATE_FILE>

<!-- 
Specifies the index file that will be created as output.  Other files 
that may be linked from this file will be automatically created in the
same directory and with the same extension.  File path can be absolute, 
or relative to this file.

If using the html template, you may want to use the following:
<INDEX_FILE>../sitemap/index.html</INDEX_FILE>

-->
<INDEX_FILE>../../../sitemap_store/CSAen_StoreSiteDE/index_CSAen.xml</INDEX_FILE>

<!-- 
Specifies location of index from which to build links, and query parameters 
to use.  Note that in most cases N=0 is appropriate for retrieving all 
records.  Use multiple ENGINEs if running in an Agraph deployment.

To run an aggregate query, append the following tag: ROLLUP_KEY

For example,
<MDEX_ENGINES>
  <ENGINE>
      <HOST>localhost</HOST>
      <PORT>15000</PORT>
      <ROOT_QUERY><![CDATA[N=0]]></ROOT_QUERY>
      <ROLLUP_KEY>product.code</ROLLUP_KEY>
  </ENGINE>
</MDEX_ENGINES>
-->
<MDEX_ENGINES>
  <ENGINE>
    <HOST>localhost</HOST>
    <PORT>15000</PORT>
    <ROOT_QUERY><![CDATA[N=0&Nr=AND(product.priceListPair:plist3080003_plist3080002,product.siteId:storeSiteDE)]]></ROOT_QUERY>
	  <ROLLUP_KEY>product.repositoryId</ROLLUP_KEY>
  </ENGINE>
</MDEX_ENGINES>

<!-- 
Specifies fields (dimension and/or property names) that should be included
with every record in the query results. If nothing is specified in this section,
only those properties and dimensions that are enabled for display with record list
will be returned with each record. Entering a value within this list overrides
the application settings, so it can be used to expand or restrict the returned data.
For example, specifying a property P_Name in the list will return only the value
of this one property with every record, even if this property is not enabled
for display with record list in the application configuration files. In this example,
no other property or dimension values will be returned.

Example:
<QUERY_FIELD_LIST>
   <QUERY_FIELD>P_Name</QUERY_FIELD>
</QUERY_FIELD_LIST>

Note: Only one QUERY_FIELD_LIST tag will be read by the Sitemap Generator. If more
than one lists are included in the config file, only the first one will be used.
-->

<QUERY_FIELD_LIST>
  <QUERY_FIELD>product.category</QUERY_FIELD>
  <QUERY_FIELD>product.brand</QUERY_FIELD>
  <QUERY_FIELD>product.displayName</QUERY_FIELD>
</QUERY_FIELD_LIST>

<!--
Specifies the search terms file to use if/when building search term links.  
File path can be absolute, or relative to this file.
-->
<SEARCH_TERMS_FILE>searchterms.xml</SEARCH_TERMS_FILE>

<!--
Specifies the static pages file to use if/when building static page links.  
File path can be absolute, or relative to this file.
-->
<STATIC_PAGES_FILE>staticpages.txt</STATIC_PAGES_FILE>


<!--
Specifies the file used for formatting Urls.   Optional.
-->
<URL_FORMAT_FILE>endeca-seo-url-config.xml</URL_FORMAT_FILE>

<!-- 
Defines the component that is loaded from the urlconfig.xml file, and 
that will be used to process all FORMATTEDURL tags.
Required for running of the SiteMapGenerator.
-->
<URLFORMATTER_COMPONENT>seoUrlFormatter</URLFORMATTER_COMPONENT>


<!--
Specifies the encoding used for formatting URLs.   Optional (if unspecified, UTF-8 is used).
-->
<URL_ENCODING>UTF-8</URL_ENCODING>

<!--
Include aggregate record query parameters in generated URLs.  Can be true or false.
Optional (if unspecified, it will be set to false).
-->
<URL_INCLUDE_AGGR_REC_PARAMS>false</URL_INCLUDE_AGGR_REC_PARAMS>

<!-- 
Limits the number of links written to a file before a new file is created.  
Use this parameter to indirectly control the size of  individual index files.
-->
<LINKS_PER_FILE>10000</LINKS_PER_FILE>

<!-- 
Limits the number of total records processed.  ALL_RECS indicates that all
records should be processed.
-->
<MAX_RECS>70000</MAX_RECS>

<!-- 
Specifies one or more navigation page specs (see below.) If none are specified, 
no navigation page links will be generated.
-->
<NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC_LIST>

  <!-- 
    Specifies unique combination of dimensions that will be used to generate 
    navigation page links.  For example, if Dimension A and Dimension B are 
    specified, all unique and valid combinations A + B will be listed.

    Note that any dimensions specified in a navigation page spec must also be
    enabled for display in the results list of an Endeca query.
    
    The FULL_HIERARCHY attribute should be set to "True" if you wish to
    traverse the Dimension's ancestor.  For example, if you have a Dimension
    hierarchy of Sample 1 -> Sample 2 -> Sample 3 for Another Sample Dimension, 
    the FULL_HIERARCHY should be set to "True" if you wish to write
    navigation pages for Sample 2 values.

    WARNING - This functionality behaves in a very combinatoric way.  It is 
    strongly suggested that only two or fewer dimensions be specified for 
    a given spec. Otherwise, millions of links could easily be generated.
  -->
  <NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>
    <DIMENSION_NAME FULL_HIERARCHY="True">product.category</DIMENSION_NAME>
  </NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>
  <NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>
    <DIMENSION_NAME FULL_HIERARCHY="False">product.brand</DIMENSION_NAME>
  </NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>    
  <NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>
    <DIMENSION_NAME FULL_HIERARCHY="True">product.category</DIMENSION_NAME>
    <DIMENSION_NAME FULL_HIERARCHY="False">product.brand</DIMENSION_NAME>
  </NAVIGATION_PAGE_SPEC>
