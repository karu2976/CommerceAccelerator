XML Template - Generates Sitemaps XML 
files, according to standard sitemap XML format.  See https://www.sitemaps.org
for more details.

How It Works - Each XML element of template is loaded into application.
Note the use of CDATA to avoid encoding all embedded XML.  Where appropriate, 
application will replace **KEY** with dynamic values.  Application
then builds output files and links writing out modified values in
appropriate order.  (HEADER, LINK, LINK, LINK... ,FOOTER.)
